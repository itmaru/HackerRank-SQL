You are given two tables: Students and Grades. 

Ketty gives Eve a task to generate a report containing three columns: Name, Grade and Mark. Ketty doesn't want the NAMES of those students who received a grade lower than 8. The report must be in descending order by grade -- i.e. higher grades are entered first. If there is more than one student with the same grade (8-10) assigned to them, order those particular students by their name alphabetically. Finally, if the grade is lower than 8, use "NULL" as their name and list them by their grades in descending order. If there is more than one student with the same grade (1-7) assigned to them, order those particular students by their marks in ascending order.

JOIN Grades ON Students.Marks = Grades.Grade;

SELECT (CASE
        WHEN Grades.Grade > 8 TRUE THEN Students.Name
        ELSE Null
        END) FROM Students;

*/

SELECT (CASE Grades.Grade >= 8 WHEN TRUE THEN Students.Name ELSE Null END), 
Grades.Grade, Students.Marks
FROM Students
JOIN Grades ON Students.Marks BETWEEN min_mark AND max_mark
ORDER BY Grades.Grade DESC, Students.Name, Students.Marks;
